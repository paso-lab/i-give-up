Currently, we have several ongoing research studies that you may be eligible for. You may be eligible if you:

1. have excessive clutter in your home or hoarding,
2. have been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder,
3. have difficulties with worry or depressed mood,
4. struggle with anger issues,
5. are psychologically healthy (i.e., you have never been diagnosed with a psychological disorder or received treatment for psychological problems).

Our studies focus on examining how different thoughts, behaviors, emotions, or biological factors are involved with psychiatric symptoms. We hope that these studies will help us better understand how to prevent and treat disorders across the OC and anxiety spectrum.

Participation involves completing different interviews, questionnaires, computer tasks, and measures of physiological responding (e.g. heart rate). These studies involve 1-2 visits to our program and take up to 2 Â½ hours per session to complete. To determine which (or all) of these studies is a good fit for you, we will first complete a brief phone interview with you. If you are eligible based on the phone interview, the first visit will involve a diagnostic interview, for which you would be offered informal feedback about your emotional health.

If you are eligible and interested in participating, you would be compensated for your time. The exact amount depends on the specific studies you participate in and how many of them you complete.
