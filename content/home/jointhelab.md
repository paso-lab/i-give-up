## Graduate Students in Clinical Psychology
Training future clinical-scientists is one of the most important components of the work we do. Our research group is collaborative and operates within a "hands-on" training model. Graduate students are involved in all aspects of the research process from their very first day in the program. The UM Psychology Department offers a rich environment in which to grow as a clinical researcher, with excellent training in research and empirically validated treatments.

Please see the UM Psychology Department Graduate Admissions webpage for more information on how to apply.

## Undergraduate Research Assistants (RAs)
Undergraduate research assistants (RAs) are very closely integrated into the PASO lab. Duties can vary depending on the specific study, but can include tasks such as helping with literature searches, participant recruitment, conducting experimental sessions, and coding/entering data. More senior research assistants might also have the opportunity to receive training in conducting clinical phone screens, facilitating groups for hoarding, and helping to present study findings at scientific meetings and conferences.

**Requirements:** RAs are expected to commit at least 9 hours per week to working in the lab and having a minimum GPA of 3.5. A two or more semester commitment is preferred. If you are interested in becoming part of the PASO lab as a research assistant, please email us expressing your interest and attach your resume at paso@psy.miami.edu. We will then ask you to fill out a brief application.
