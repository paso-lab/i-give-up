Caitlin Brown is a third year graduate student in clinical psychology. Caitlin received a BA in psychology and a BA in comparative literature from Columbia University in 2013, and she received her M.S. in clinical psychology from the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona in 2015. Caitlin's research focuses on modeling vulnerability factors for anxiety disorders using advanced statistical methods. She is interested in the interaction between genetic risk factors, stressful life events, information processing deficits, and emotional tolerance factors on vulnerability for anxiety symptoms, broadly, and hoarding symptoms in particular. Caitlin is currently working on a project involving candidate genes and risk-taking behavior in anxiety spectrum disorders, as well as a project investigating the measurement of emotional impulsivity and its role in predicting hoarding-related cognitions and behaviors. Additional topics of interest for Caitlin include investigating the impact of linguistic and cultural factors on psychological symptoms in bilingual individuals, as well as better understanding overlapping cognitive abnormalities that may contribute to comorbid hoarding and schizophrenia symptoms. For her dissertation, she hopes to employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze speech patterns in patients with hoarding disorder
